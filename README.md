# Three Kata Websites

Throughout the Code Your Future course, you have completed several CodeWars projects, also known as [katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata#Outside_martial_arts).

For most of these katas you will have interacted with them via code: by calling a function or from a test suite. This is a good way to practice solving a problem but unfortunately non-developers will have a hard time seeing what you've built.

It is a good idea to show off your work on these katas by creating a website that allows anyone to interact with your code.

You should focus on building an intuitive and good-looking website that integrates the code that you **already** wrote by completing CodeWars challenges. **Don't** try to solve new katas!

## Instructions

- Look through your completed CodeWars projects and pick 3 that you would like to turn into websites
- Build out the website, using whatever technology you like.
  - You could pick the technology based on what you feel comfortable with, or try to learn something new!
  - If you are having a hard time picking, try using the randomly selected technologies from [1000 Paper Cranes](https://1000-paper-cranes.netlify.app/)!
- Deploy your kata websites to Netlify (or another hosting platform)
- Add links to the kata websites to [your portfolio](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Portfolio)

## Acceptance criteria

You **don't** need to submit a pull request to this repo to complete this challenge.

- [ ] Deploy the websites
- [ ] Add links to your portfolio
